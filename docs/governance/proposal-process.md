# Proposal Process

This page explains how governance proposals are created and processed.

1. Idea / Discussion — Start on the community forum or GitHub Discussions.
2. Draft Proposal — Prepare a clear specification, rationale, and economic impact.
3. Submission — Submit the proposal to the governance portal or create an on-chain proposal (if available).
4. Review — Community and maintainers review; feedback is incorporated.
5. Voting — Proposal goes to on-chain vote (see Voting doc for thresholds).
6. Execution — If passed, owners or an executor contract enacts the change (subject to timelock).

Best practices
- Include tests and upgrade/rollback plans.
- Provide clear migration and funding implications.
